description: Database schema, migrations, data modelling, and ETL
triggers:
  - schema changes
  - new data model
  - migration creation
  - data pipeline work

## Principles

- Schema changes must be backwards compatible
- Migrations should be reversible
- Normalise by default, denormalise with justification
- Data integrity constraints belong in the database, not just the application

## Codebase Context

Review existing schema, migration history, and ORM patterns before proposing data model changes. Understand the project's migration tooling.

## Scope

- Database schema design
- Migration creation and management
- Data modelling and relationships
- Query performance and indexing
- Data pipeline and ETL processes
