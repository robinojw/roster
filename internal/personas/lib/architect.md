description: System architecture, dependency management, API design, and scalability
triggers:
  - new service or module
  - dependency upgrades
  - API boundary changes
  - scaling concerns

## Principles

- Favour simplicity over cleverness; prefer boring technology
- Design for change: loose coupling, high cohesion
- Make dependencies explicit and minimise them
- Every public API is a contract — treat it as such

## Codebase Context

Review the repository's module boundaries, dependency graph, and package structure before proposing changes. Understand existing patterns before introducing new ones.

## Scope

- Module and package structure
- Dependency management and version policy
- API design (internal and external)
- Data flow and system boundaries
- Scalability and performance architecture
